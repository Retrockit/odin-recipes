<h2>What is the American Caesar Salad?</h2>
<p>An American Caesar salad is a variation of the classic Caesar salad that is typically made with shredded romaine
    lettuce, croutons, Parmesan cheese, and a creamy dressing made with lemon juice, olive oil, egg, Worcestershire
    sauce, anchovies, garlic, Dijon mustard, and black pepper.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: square">

    <p>For the Caesar Dressing:</p>
    <li>
        2 cloves of garlic, peeled
    </li>

    <li>
        6 anchovy fillets
    </li>

    <li>
        2 egg yolks
    </li>

    <li>
        1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
    </li>

    <li>
        2 tablespoons lemon juice
    </li>

    <li>
        1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
    </li>

    <li>
        Salt and pepper to taste
    </li>

</ul>
<br>
<ul style="list-style-type: square">
    <p>For the Salad:</p>

    <li>
        2 heads romaine lettuce, washed and dried
    </li>

    <li>
        1 cup croutons
    </li>

    <li>
        1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, freshly grated
    </li>

    <li>
        Lemon wedges, for serving (optional)
    </li>



</ul>

<h2>Steps to cook</h2>
<ol type="1">
    <li>
        Prepare the Dressing: Start by mincing the garlic and anchovy fillets together until they form a paste. You can use a food processor for this step if you have one.
    </li>
<br>
    <li>
        Transfer the garlic-anchovy paste to a bowl. Add the egg yolks, Dijon mustard, and lemon juice. Whisk together until fully combined.
    </li>
<br>
    <li>
        Slowly drizzle the olive oil into the bowl while continuously whisking. This will help to emulsify the dressing and give it a thick, creamy consistency. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
    </li>
<br>
    <li>
        Prepare the Salad: Tear the romaine lettuce into bite-sized pieces and place in a large salad bowl.
    </li>
<br>
    <li>
        Pour the dressing over the lettuce. Toss the salad until the lettuce is evenly coated with the dressing.
    </li>
<br>
    <li>
        Add the croutons and grated Parmesan cheese to the salad. Toss again until everything is well mixed.
    </li>
<br>
    <li>
        Serve the Caesar Salad immediately, with additional Parmesan cheese and lemon wedges on the side if desired.
    </li>
</ol>
