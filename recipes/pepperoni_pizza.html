<ul style="list-style-type: square">
    <p>For the Tomato Sauce:</p>
    <li>
        1 can (15 ounces) crushed tomatoes
    </li>

    <li>

    </li>

    <li>

    </li>

    <li>
        1 teaspoon dried oregano
    </li>

    <li>
        Salt and pepper to taste
    </li>


</ul>

<br>
<ul style="list-style-type: square">
    <p>For the topping:</p>
    <li>
        2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
    </li>

    <li>
        1/2 cup sliced pepperoni
    </li>

    <li>
        2 tablespoons olive oil (for brushing)
    </li>

    <li>
        1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
    </li>

    <li>
        1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
    </li>

</ul>


<h2>Steps to cook</h2>
<ol type="1">
    <li>
        Prepare the Dough: Combine the warm water and sugar in a bowl. Stir until sugar is dissolved. Sprinkle the yeast
        over the water and let it sit for 5 minutes until it becomes foamy.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the middle and pour in the yeast mixture and olive
        oil. Stir with a spoon or your hands until a dough starts to form.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead for about 10 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic.
        You can also use a stand mixer with a dough hook for this step.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours, or
        until it doubles in size.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        Prepare the Sauce: While the dough is rising, you can make the sauce. In a saucepan, combine the crushed
        tomatoes, minced garlic, sugar, and dried oregano. Season with salt and pepper. Simmer over low heat for 15-20
        minutes, stirring occasionally. Set aside to cool.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        Assemble the Pizza: Preheat your oven to its highest setting, typically around 500-550 degrees Fahrenheit. If
        you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven while preheating.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        Once the dough has risen, punch it down to release the air. Transfer it to a floured surface. Roll out the dough
        into your desired size, keeping in mind it should fit on your pizza stone or baking sheet.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        If you're using a pizza stone, transfer the rolled-out dough onto a piece of parchment paper. If you're using a
        baking sheet, you can just place the dough directly onto it.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        Spread a layer of the prepared tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a small border for the crust. Sprinkle the
        shredded mozzarella evenly over the sauce, and arrange the pepperoni slices over the cheese.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        Bake the Pizza: Carefully transfer the pizza (and parchment paper, if using) onto your preheated pizza stone, or
        place your baking sheet in the oven. Bake for about 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese
        is bubbling and starting to brown.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        While the pizza is baking, combine the olive oil, garlic powder, and dried oregano in a small bowl. Once the
        pizza is done, brush this mixture over the crust.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving. Enjoy your homemade
        pepperoni pizza!
    </li>
